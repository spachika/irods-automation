Block1:
Ansible ping to ubuntu 16 AMI failed
Cause:
Python is by default not available in ubuntu 16 AMI.
ansible is pull based and python is mandatory to connect with nodes.
Resolution:
connected to ubuntu remote using SSH and installed python

Block2:
creation of DB in postgresSQL engine using ansible playbooks
Cause:
psycopg2 module is required for python to execute sql on postgresSQL
Resolution:
Installed python-pip from apt repository. It is required for installing python modules

Block3:
execution of setup_irods.py using ansible playbook failed
Cause:
setup_irods.py is a interactive script. Ansible checks only task completion like yes or no
but cannot run interactive script
Resolution:
Identified that json file can be passed to setup_irods.py. Tried to edit the json file but
am not that good at json. So configured irods manually
